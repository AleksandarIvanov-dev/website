                    Think of coding as writing the actual instructions for a computer, while programming is the bigger picture
                    â€“ it involves planning, problem-solving, and making sure everything works smoothly.

                    Coding is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand, using a specific programming language like Python, Java, or C++.
                    Simply put, itâ€™s like giving a computer a set of step-by-step directions to follow.
                    The coding meaning comes down to translating human ideas into a language that machines can process.
                    Computers only understand the language of ones and zeros, also known as binary, which is completely different from how we naturally communicate.

                    While coding is a big part of software development, it is not the most important part. To create a product, you need to take several additional steps.
                    They include planning, design, testing, deployment, and even maintenance.
                    Altogether, the whole process can be called programming.

                    But enough about the theory, letâ€™s get our hands dirty with some practical coding!
