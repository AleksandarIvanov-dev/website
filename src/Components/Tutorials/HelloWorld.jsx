                It is often used as a first program for beginners to learn the syntax of a programming language.
                This tutorial will guide you through writing your first "Hello, World!" program in various programming languages.
                Writing your first line of code is an important step in learning any programming language.

                Even though it seems simple, this first step helps you understand how code is written, saved, and executed, building your confidence to explore more complex concepts as you continue learning.
